    <h1 id="title">My Favorite Superhero Spider-Man</h1>
    <h2 id="subtitle">Why Spider-Man is my favorite</h2>

    <p id="p1">
      Spider-Man is my favorite superhero because he feels relatable and realistic.
      Even though he has superpowers, he still deals with normal problems like school,
      work, and relationships. That makes him easier to connect with than heroes who
      have unlimited money or are basically unstoppable.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
      Another reason I like Spider-Man is his sense of responsibility. He tries to do
      the right thing even when it’s difficult or when it costs him something. Plus He
      Doesn't use his powers to his full extent in fear of harming others from hitting to hard.
      I also like him just because he's such a unique character, and in the way
      that not only are his powers unique, but it's that without his intellect, he couldn't
      be Spider-Man to begin with; he needed his intellect to create his web shooters.
