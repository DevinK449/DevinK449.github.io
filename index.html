  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="about">
    <p>My mission is to always keep learning and improving in everything that I do,
    especially in technology and problem solving skills. I want to work hard and use my creativity to
    find solutions that can help people and make their lives easier. I believe that staying curious and
    never giving up is the best way to grow and reach new goals.
    I also want to be someone who is very dependable and positive, both in school and in future
    jobs. I believe that teamwork is important, and I want to be the kind of person who supports
    others and learns from them, especially if there's criticism. By being open to new challenges, I
    know I can keep moving forward and become stronger in both knowledge and character.
    In the future, I hope to have a career where I can use my skills to make a real difference. I want
    to be remembered as someone who worked hard, cared about others, and always tried to leave
    things better than they found them.</p>

    <!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->

      <a href="files/statement.pdf">
        <img src="images/problem.png" alt="Problem Statement Image">
      </a>
      <p><strong>One-sentence:</strong> Students at USC who have to use Blackboard, GitHub, and Discord for schoolwork need one simple place to see all their assignments, deadlines, and group tasks so they don’t lose track or miss work.</p>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Full problem statement</strong> (click to expand)</summary>
        <p><strong>Who:</strong> College students at the University of South Carolina who take multiple classes and work on group projects through Blackboard, GitHub, and Discord.</p>
        <p><strong>What:</strong> It’s hard to keep track of everything when all the due dates, messages, and files are spread across different apps. Students end up missing deadlines or forgetting tasks.</p>
        <p><strong>Where:</strong> Most of this happens when students are studying, in class, or working on projects from their laptops or phones.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> When everything is in different places, it’s stressful and confusing. Having to switch between apps takes time and makes it easy to forget what’s due or who’s doing what.</p>
        <p><strong>Constraints:</strong> The solution should work with the tools students already use instead of replacing them. It should also be easy to check quickly from a phone or laptop.</p>
        <p><strong>How we’ll know it works:</strong> Students miss fewer deadlines, it’s faster to find what needs to be done, and teams feel more organized and know what everyone’s working on.</p>
