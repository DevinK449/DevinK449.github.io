  <h1>Devin King</h1>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="about"><p>My Devin Kingâ€™s mission is to always keep learning and improving in everything that I do,
especially in technology and problem solving skills. I want to work hard and use my creativity to
find solutions that can help people and make their lives easier. I believe that staying curious and
never giving up is the best way to grow and reach new goals.
I also want to be someone who is very dependable and positive, both in school and in future
jobs. I believe that teamwork is important, and I want to be the kind of person who supports
others and learns from them especially if there's criticism. By being open to new challenges, I
know I can keep moving forward and become stronger in both knowledge and character.
In the future, I hope to have a career where I can use my skills to make a real difference. I want
to be remembered as someone who worked hard, cared about others, and always tried to leave
things better than they found them.</p></div>
